# What It Does #
This project was designed to show the use of basic java and OOP concepts by building a program that could take a formatted list of films in a .txt file and build a collection of 'movie' objects as a collection, then run defined queries on this collection and output the results to command line.

# What I Learned #
* Basic Java concepts (instance variables, methods, file I/O, collections, comparator interface etc)
* OOP Concepts (Classes, basic Interfaces)
* General programming concepts (Testing and iteration)

I also learned the basics of managing a project on Github through the original upload of this project.

# Usage Notes #
Compile in your favorite Java editor, or on command line using javac. Ensure films.txt is in root. This program has no command-line arguments.
